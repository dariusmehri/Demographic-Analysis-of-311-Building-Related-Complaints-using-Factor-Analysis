# Factor Analysis of 311 Department of Building Incidents

Every day there are thousands of 311 calls made about building incidents, and a significant portion of those are directed to the Department of Buildings (DOB). However, a significant number of 311 calls aren’t directed to the DOB when they should be. Given the importance of
building safety, and the accidents that can occur when buildings aren’t kept up to code, we
decided it would be useful to explore this unrouted data to determine what it could tell us about building safety. 

#Data
The data consisted of 311 calls between January and June 2015. Variables in the 311 database related to DOB incidents but are not routed to the agency included: noise related to construction, building water leaks, sewer backup,water main break, no access to building, obstruction of sidewalk, air and ventilation issues, dirty water and no water and water drainage (catch basin). Control variables included construction permits, income, percent non-English speakers and race variables that incluced white, Asian and African American. Demographic variables were included because recent research suggests that the decision to call 311 is associated with socio-economic status, race and whether the person is from a country outside of the United States.
