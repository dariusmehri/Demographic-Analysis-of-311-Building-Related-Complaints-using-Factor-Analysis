# Factor Analysis of 311 Department of Building-Incidents

Every day there are thousands of 311 calls made about building incidents, and a significant portion of those are directed to the Department of Buildings (DOB). That being said, a significant number of 311 calls aren’t directed to the DOB when they should be. Given the importance of
building safety, and the accidents that can occur when buildings aren’t kept up to code, we
decided it would be useful to explore this data to determine what it could tell us about building safety.
