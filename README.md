# Factor Analysis of 311 Department of Building-Incidents

Every day there are thousands of 311 calls made about building incidents, and a significant portion of those are directed to the Department of buildings. That being said, we estimate that
about 5% of 311 calls aren’t directed to the DOB when they should be. Given the importance of
building safety, and the accidents that can occur when buildings aren’t kept up to code, we
decided it would be interesting and potentially useful to explore the 311 call data to determine if
and what it could tell us about building safety. We were also curious to find out whether or not
we could use the data to root out bad actors or find illegal activity.
